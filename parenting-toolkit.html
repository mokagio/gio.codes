    <h1>Parenting Toolkit</h1>
    <p><i>There are many kinds of success in life worth having. It is exceedingly interesting and attractive to be a successful businessman, or railway man, or farmer, or a successful lawyer or doctor; or a writer, or a President, or a ranchman, or the colonel of a ghting regiment, or to kill grizzly bears and lions. But for un agging interest and enjoyment, a household of children, if things go reasonably well, certainly makes all other forms of success and achievement lose their importanceby comparison.</br>‚ÄìTheodore Roosevelt</i></p>

    <p>This page is a long note-to-self with books and other resources about parenting I want to periodically revisit. It will always be in a work in progress stage. The list is in no particular order. Beneath, there is a bit of <a href="#advice">advice</a>, stuff I wished someone told me and that I need to keep repeating myself.</p>

    <p><i>There are probably typos in here, if not outright wrong grammar. This page is <a href="https://github.com/mokagio/gio.codes/blob/gh-pages/parenting-toolkit.html">open source</a>, feel free to open a PR.</i></p>

    <h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28815322-the-danish-way-of-parenting">The Danish Way of Parenting</a></h3>

    <p>P.A.R.E.N.T. Play. Autenticity. Reframing. Empathy. No ultimatums. Togetherdness (<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygge">Hygge</a></i>).</p>

    <h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6452796-drive">Drive</a></h3>
    <p>This is a deep dive into how motivation works and why the classic "carrots and stick" is obsolete. Most of the book is about business, but there is a part at the end about parenting too. In fact, the overall principals can be applied at any level.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41795733-range">Range</a></h3>
    <p>David Epstein talks about the value of learning a variety of skills rather than specilizing too early. When it comes to parenting, this is the exact opposite of what the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_parenting">tiger parenting</a>" movement is all about.</p>
    <p>The book also touches on education, specifically on how inadequate the education model that we still have from the Industrial Revolution is, not only in a world where the market is changing so quickly, but for the very essence of stimulating curiosity and building a passion for learning. I'm quite resigned that my kids will go to a school that won't be able to look after them the way they ‚Äìand every other young mind‚Äì deserves. It will be up to us parents to <i><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/294032.The_Unschooled_Mind">unschool</a></i> them, compensate for the damage done to their creativity, while still give them the tools to survive through school.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44595007-indistractable">Indistractable</a></h3>
    <p>While I wasn't particularly satisfied by the depth and originality of the writing throughout the book, the part on how to raise indistractable children was quite good. Technology, and smartphones in particular, are dangerous tools that our children should learn to use appropriately. As parents, it's up to us to teach them how, gradually giving them more and more freedom in the digital world, once they've shown they deserve it.</p>
    <p>The analogy the author uses is that of a swimming pool. You wouldn't just throw your child in the water. You'd want to teach them to swim first, and keep supervise them till you're confident they can play safely with no risk of drowning.</p>

    <h3><a href="#">The Last Lecture</a></h3>
    <p>I think everyone should read this book. Randy Pausch was diagnosed with cancer and when invited to give a lecture, he made it about life advice.</p>
    -->

    <h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23399024-i-know-how-she-does-it">I know how she does it</a></h3>
    <p>Laura Vanderkam is a mom and an author; she has written volumes about time management. The book is all about how get more out of your life by mindfully scheduling your time. There are many parts focused on parenting and family life.</p>
    <p>For the dads, this book was written based on Vanderkam's collection of "hour-by-hour time logs from 1,001 days in the lives of working mothers who make at least $100,000 a year." So, the ideal reader is a working mom.  This makes the book <i>even more valuable</i> for us, as it gives an insights on the challenges our partners face which might not be clear to us.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18077875-essentialism">Essentialism</a></h3>
    <p>The book is all about how identify the <i>vital few</i> among the <i>trivial many</i>, and then execute on them. Arguably, parenting should be one of those vital few.</p>
    <p>There is an anectode, about how a father made a promise to spend time with his daughter during a business trip to a convention, planning all the activities ahead of time. At some point, a fellow business man invited the father out for dinner while he was about to go out with his daugther. The father politely declined, possibly missing out on the chance of strengthening a business relationship or making a profitable deal. To the daughter, this made all the difference in the world. It drove home to me how our children will remember us for the time we spent with them and the things we did together, not for how much money we made or how many cool products we shipped.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38232376-nine-pints">Nine Pints</a></h3>
    <p>This is a terrific work on non-fiction exploring blood. Of the nine chapters, the central ones are about menstruation and the many stigmas and taboos that are attached to it, not just in the undeveloped world. Whether you have a boy or a girl, I think it's paramount that you seek to understand this and other "girl topics". I would hate for my daughter not to feel comfortable to talk about this kind of things with me, the same way I would hate if my son didn't show her sister the respect she deserves.</p>

    <p>Speaking of men not respecting women, spend 5 minutes to watch "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PscD6h1iNiI">We Are The Lions</a>". It'll make you think.</p>

    <h2>Kids Books &amp; Toys</h2>

    <h3><a href="https://www.andreabeaty.com/rosie-revere-engineer.html">Rosie Revere, Engineer</a> and the other <i>Questioneer</i> books</h3>
    <p>I get emotional every time I read this book. Such a powerful story about not giving up.</p>

    <blockquote>
      She turned round to leave, but then Great-Great-Aunt Rose<br>
      grabbed hold of young Rosie and pulled her in close<br>
      and hugged her and kissed her and started to cry.<br>
      ‚ÄúYou did it! Hooray! It‚Äôs the perfect first try!<br>
      This great flop is over. It‚Äôs time for the next!‚Äù<br>
      Young Rosie was baffled, embarrassed, perplexed.<br>
      ‚ÄúI failed,‚Äù said dear Rosie. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just made of trash.<br>
      Didn‚Äôt you see it? The cheese-copter crashed.‚Äù<br>
      ‚ÄúYes!‚Äù said her great aunt. ‚ÄúIt crashed. That is true.<br>
      But first it did just what it needed to do.<br>
      Before it crashed, Rosie...<br>
      before that...<br>
      it flew!‚Äù<br>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>TODO: there are many more that deserve to be listed here...</i></p>

    <h2 id="advice">Advice</h2>

    <p>As soon as you announce you're expecting, <i>everyone</i> will start telling you what to do and how to do it. As the children grow, people will judge you for how you raise them.</p>
    <p>Fuck. All. That.</p>
    <p>Every child is different and perfect. There is no one-size-fits-all solution. Use your best judgement, try things out. Just because other people are doing it, it doesn't mean it'll work for you. <i>That applies to this advice too.</i></p>

    <h3>On breastfeeding</h3>
    <p>We had an horrible experience with our first born. The midwives kept making my wife feel bad for not getting milk, which by the way is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colostrum">normal</a>, even more so with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesarean_section">c-sections</a>. The baby went for almost a week with just a few drops spoonfed to him because he wasn't latching. He got more and more unhappy and dehydrated.</p>

    <p>The midwives never mentioned formula. Only when we got home the nurse that came visit suggested to integrate with formula. Once we did that, he was fine.</p>

    <p>It took him six weeks to learn how to breastfeed. After that, we couldn't get him off!</p>

    <p>Keep trying, don't give up. It'll take time, but it's worth it. And if it doesn't work out, no worries. Bottle fed babies grow up just fine.</p>

    <h3>On sleeping</h3>
    <p>Our kids are terrible sleepers. With our first, it took more than two years before he slept through the night more often than not. He still wakes up and wants to play every now and again. In the nine months she's been with us, our daughter hasn't slept for more than four hours at a time. Ever.</p>
    <p>The kids of some of our friends slept through the night after a few months, weeks some time.</p>
    <p>If your kids don't sleep, it's not your fault. We tried them all; they just won't sleep. It's the genes lottery I guess, we just didn't get lucky on that front.</p>

    <p>And don't get me started on books like <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8479791-save-our-sleep">Save Our Sleep</a>. If letting your child cry themselves to sleep works for you, good. I can't do it. After a short while, I'll go there and comfort them. I can't <i>drink a full cup of tea</i> while they cry, I just can't.</p>

    <h3>Be present</h3>
    <p>Look I don't consider myself an expert on parenting, I'm only three years through the journey, but something I noticed now that we have two children is that you will forget the little details. There's just too much stuff happening in those first years, it might be a clich√©, but yeah, they do grow so fast.</p>
    <p>Going through the experience of having a baby the second time, I realized I was rediscovering the feeling of holding a new born. I had forgotten how it felt. The same way I have forgotten so many funny things they did and said over time. Unfortunately, it's just how our minds work. So when you're with them, just be with them.</p>
    <p>Sometimes, I see people on Twitter asking recommendations for one-handed apps to use while bottle feeding, or posting pictures of them and their kids watching tech talks during meal time. Why?! Why not just being there with your child and enjoying the experience? The bottles and spoon feeds are numbered. Once they're gone they're gone. Don't waste them being distracted on something else.</p>
    <p>I imagine I'll get to hold little babies again as times goes by, and I might be surprised again about how it feels. If that will happen, I want to have no regrets. I want to know I made the most of when it was my turn to hold my children.</p>

    <h3>One on one time</h3>
    <p>Make sure to have one on one time with your children. It's great bonding time for you, and good relax time for your partner. Getting to bring my son to swimming lessons and being part of his development there is one of the highlights of my life. I'm so thankful I got to do it.</p>

    <h3>For Dads</h3>
    <p>From the moment you see that positive pregnancy test, you don't get to be tired or sore. Do not complain in front of your partner. Just don't. She'll always be more tired and sore than you are, she's growing a baby inside her belly, an extraneous organism sucking her resources. If you need to complain with someone, call a mate.</p>
    <p>But don't have a drink with a mate. Your partner will give up drinking for the sake of the baby. Be supportive. I didn't do this during our first pregnancy, and I'm not proud of it. To be clear, is not like I ever came home drunk or anything, but even just enjoying a drink when together at a social gathering is like rubbing it in her face that while she's struggling growing the baby, you get to enjoy the usual complete control over your body.</p>
    <p><i>Followup:</i> I didn't drink during our second pregnancy and I decided to keep it up even after our daughter was born. I've had only a handful of drinks since. You can't afford to be hangover with little children and it feels good to play the long game, drinking is borrowing energy from your future self, practice some restraint and your future self will say thank you.</p>
