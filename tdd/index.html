      <li>Why testing</li>

      <li>TDD vs Testing</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 id="toc_5">2. How to TDD a new object</h4>
    <p><em>Let's build a list view data source from scratch driven by tests.</em></p>

    <!--
    <ul>
      I want to talk about this for sure, but this might not be the best place after all.
      <li>What if your app was a CLI? <em>To effectively TDD iOS applications we need to keep as much logic outside the scope of <code>UIKit</code> as possible, treating the framework only as the delivery layer for our information to the user, and for the user interactions to our business logic.</em></li>
      <li>TDD your first property: <code>MenuDataSource</code> number of sections.</li>
      <li>TDD your first method: number of rows in section.</li>
      <li>Get <code>Pizza</code> for row in section

        <ul>
          <li>The refactor step in red, green, refactor.</li>
        </ul></li>
    </ul>
      -->

    <h4 id="toc_6">3. How to put a <code>UIViewController</code> in a test harness</h4>
      <p><em>View controllers can be tested like any other object, as long as you are aware of a few gotchas.</em></p>

    <ul>
      <li>How to setup the application scaffold and remove Xcode&#39;s unnecessary boilerplate</li>
      <li>TDD adding a view controller to the app</li>
      <li>View controller life cycle and tests</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 id="toc_7">4. How to test the contents of the UI</h4>
    <p><em>How to apply the humble view pattern to split what should be displayed from how it should be displayed.</em></p>

    <h4 id="toc_8">5. How to change existing code driven by tests</h4>
    <p><em>TDD is not only a tool to create new code, it also allows to change existing one.</em></p>

    <h4 id="toc_9">6. How to test delegates</h4>
    <p><em>You can write test doubles to inspect how components interact with each other, these are called Spies.</em></p>

    <h4 id="toc_10">7. How to TDD code talking with the network</h4>
    <p><em>We'll look at the different approaches to testing code interfacing with hte network and their tradeoffs</em></p>

    <h4 id="toc_11">8. How to TDD code storing data</h4>
    <p><em>How to abstract the statefulness for storage behind a protocol, how to use a Fake test double to have an in-memory storage in the tests.</em> </p>

    <h4 id="toc_12">9. How to TDD code talking with third-party dependencies</h4>
    <p><em>How to use a Dummy test double to satisfy a dependency requirement with something that doesn&#39;t affect the behavior of the system under test.</em></p>

    <h4 id="toc_13">10. How to fix a bug with TDD</h4>
    <p><em>When you find a bug, write a test to reproduce it, then use the feedback from the TDD loop to implement a fix.</em></p>

    <h4 id="toc_14">11. Testing Behaviour vs. Testing Implementation</h4>

    <p><em>Why focusing on testing behaviour is valuable in the long run.</em></p>

    <h4 id="toc_15">Conclusion</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>TDD as a software development philosophy.

        <ul>
          <li>Writing tests first doesn&#39;t actually make you slower</li>
          <li>It&#39;s all about the feedback loop</li>
        </ul></li>
    </ul>
